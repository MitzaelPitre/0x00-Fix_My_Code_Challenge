## Project Description

This project contains several tasks, each with a piece of defective code. Your goal is to fix the code so that it behaves as expected.

### Tasks

1. **FizzBuzz (Python)**  
   The task is to fix the FizzBuzz code so that when the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz" instead of just "Fizz".  
   **File:** `0-fizzbuzz.py`

2. **Print Square (JavaScript)**  
   This task involves fixing a JavaScript script that is supposed to print a square of a given size using the character `#`.  
   **File:** `1-print_square.js`

3. **Sort (Ruby)**  
   In this task, you need to fix the Ruby code so that the numbers provided as command line arguments are sorted correctly.  
   **File:** `2-sort.rb`

4. **User Password (Python)**  
   In this Python file, you need to fix the logic of the `User` class to correctly validate the user's password.  
   **File:** `3-user.py`

5. **Double Linked List (C)**  
   The task is to fix the function that deletes a node from a doubly linked list in C. Make sure the `prev` and `next` pointers are correctly adjusted when deleting a node.
